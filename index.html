      <p>A debate is a structured argument where the two sides speak for and against a specific topic. It is an
        excellent way to improve public speaking skills. Moreover, it also enhances our ability to develop a convincing
        argument. However, debate writing requires a proper format structure.</p>

        maneuver the ball into the other team’s goal without using their hands or arms. The team that scores more
        goals wins. Football is the world’s most popular ball game in numbers of participants and spectators.</p>

      <p>Sometimes one of the largest barriers to writing a research paper is trying to figure out what to write about.
        Many times the topic is supplied by the teacher, or the curriculum tells what the student should research and
        write about. However, this is not always the case. Sometimes the student is given a very broad concept to write
        a research paper on, for example, water. Within the category of water, there are many topics and subtopics that
        would be appropriate. Topics about water can include anything from the three states of water, different water
        sources, minerals found in water, how water is used by living organisms, the water cycle, or how to find water
        in the desert. The point is that “water” is a very large topic and would be too broad to be adequately covered
        in a typical 3-5 page research paper.</p>

        consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus
        with
        photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents
        make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with
        a
        School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary
        requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the
        fuss
        of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is
        the
        key.</p>

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Implemented Online Attendance Management
        System: This informs parents about their child's/children's activities in the school, instantly. Once a student
        reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps schools keep a
        record of the students' absenteeism. Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and this is stored in a
        database, which can later be checked by the Admin. The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which
        students are irregular to their classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of
        their curriculum's subjects. As soon as you enter a student's Enrollment Number or Name, details like
        availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the
        tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust and powerful that those
        students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span just after the admin enters login details into
        this tracker. All this will improve accuracy and transparency in any of the educational institutions as students
        and their parents are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave requests and absenteeism in a
        confidential manner and at reduced costs.
